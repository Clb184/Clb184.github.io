                What am I suppossed to do here?<br>
                Maybe just fooling around?<br>
                <br>
                Anyway, I've been attending university and well, I had to do web stuff + Java for some classes,
                 like how would appear on maybe one or two of my repositories. (?<br> This is mostly because
                we have to create things that are actually used for business (The most boring part) using REST, maybe appending
                Spring for Java, databases like MySQL and SQL Server, and using some frameworks or models for the structure of the projects.
                <br>
                <br>
                I'm the worst for creating user interfaces or pretty things, so that's for my other teammates and well, that
                helps a lot. They also sometimes need my help for things in the backend or some commands they don't know.
                <br>
                <br>
                Boring things but that's What I currently have to do, anyway, I'm also learning a bit more of OpenGL and I'm creating another framework.
                <br> Is going to be cleaner than my past one (even though this is embedded) and I'm using new stuff from OpenGL 4.5/6, mostly because my
                old computer from highschool only supports until 4.5 if using Windows or not so modern drivers from Mesa on Linux (I'm using Arch on it btw).
                <br>
                Maybe I'm caring too much for older hardware, but is surprising to see things I created running on it.
                <br><br>Anyway, I just wanted to test this and that's it, might update later by drawing some icons (I want to draw Index from the Toaru series
                 for the lols and add it here).
